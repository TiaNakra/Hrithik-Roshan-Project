            <p>Hrithik Roshan is an Indian actor, born on 10th January 1974, well known globally for his versatile roles, unmatchable dancing skills and attractive looks.

                After having appeared in films as a child actor in the 1980s, Roshan made his film debut in a leading role in Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai (2000) for which he earned Filmfare Awards for Best Actor and Best Male Debut. It was not just a new actor on the block, but a star was born. He became a romantic hero, an action hero and revolutionized the Hindi film industry in significant ways. Never before had any debutant become an overnight sensation of this kind.

                After his debut film, he appeared in Karan Johar' s family drama Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham (2001), which received immense love not just in India but even overseas. In 2003, Hrithik Roshan, who is often described as "India's Most Complete Actor" stunned everyone and proved once again that it is not just the uber-flattering looks that he brings to the table. This was when he flawlessly essayed the role of an intellectually disabled boy in Koi... Mil Gaya. Not only did the film set the cash registers ringing massively, but Roshan also bagged multiple awards for his acting prowess in the film, including the Filmfare Best Actor award. The makers turned it into a franchise because of the huge commercial success and love that the film received. The next installment, Krrish (2006) saw Hrithik Roshan playing a superhero, which went on to become the first ever-successful Indian superhero in Indian cinema. Roshan received his 3rd Filmfare Award for Best Actor in 2006 for his performance as an enigmatic master thief in the action film Dhoom 2, with which he redefined style and action and set new bars. He established himself as a major action star. He took stylized action to a whole new level with Bang Bang in 2014, which did massive business at the box office. In 2012, he created history in Indian cinema when his film, Agneepath minted a whopping 25 crs only on its opening day. That is the star power and pull of Hrithik Roshan. We also saw him portray the role of the Moghul emperor, Akbar the Great himself in Jodhaa Akbar (2008) for which he received immense critical acclaim and also an International award at a Film festival. In 2011, Roshan was seen in Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, which became an absolute cult classic. Before becoming an actor, Hrithik toiled as a largely uncredited assistant on film projects, gradually progressing from unglamorous tasks such as set-sweeping, tea-fetching, or clapper-loading up to a major role in story development, camera, direction, and editing. Since his entry into the industry, Hrithik has parlayed the natural gift of symmetrical features and a tall athletic frame into unimaginable standards. Through unparalleled work ethic, sheer honesty, talent, and commitment as an actor, he also effectively redefined the Hindi film hero. Actors would now have to act and dance and fight for themselves like never before. With the kind of roles Hrithik has played on screen, there is no doubt about his acting prowess and versatility. From playing a intellectually disabled boy in Koi... Mil Gaya (2003) to an emperor in Jodhaa Akbar (2008); from playing a quadriplegic in Guzaarish (2010) to a visually impaired man in Kaabil (2017), he has played diverse characters effortlessly with his sheer talent. In 2019, Hrithik continued taking on challenging roles as he marked two decades in the movies. In Super 30 (2019) he played the character of a Bihari Mathematician, Hrithik effortlessly slipped into the shoes of real-life Math genius Anand Kumar. He followed this up with War (2019), a larger-than-life Intelligence Agent gone rogue, while on a covert mission. Hrithik Roshan added act and action to his character. The actor aced at adding mystery to the thrilling story line with his screen presence as Kabir, which is considered one of the most charismatic characters he has played till date on screen. Hrithik, a hot favorite for award show performances because of his smooth dance moves, high energy, and immense charm has won 66 awards out of 84 nominations, having a win rate of an outstanding 79%. Hrithik has also won many Style and Glamour awards for his appearances and red carpet outings. He was in fact voted as the 'Most Handsome Actor in the World' in 2018 by worldstopmost.com Hrithik married his childhood sweetheart and longtime girlfriend, successful interior designer and businesswoman Sussanne Khan in December 2000. They have two sons: Hrehaan, born in 2006, and Hridaan, born in 2008. While the two got divorced in 2014, they chose to maintain cordial relations with each other for their kids and even today are good friends. - IMDb Mini Biography By: VM Often described as India's 'most complete actor' , Hrithik Roshan is the culmination of old Hindi film industry from both sides of his pedigree. His maternal grandfather - director-producer _J. Om Prakash_ - first introduced little Hrithik onscreen at age 6 by slyly having his crew shoot without the boy's knowledge as he danced on the set of Aasha (1980) while visiting grandpa. J. Om Prakash later gave young Hrithik his only actual speaking role as a child, directing him in the key role of Rajnikanth's adopted son in Bhagwaan Dada (1986). Paternal grandfather Roshan Lal Nagrath - the original "Roshan" - was a gifted classical musician and famous composer who as music director in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s helped define the emerging Bollywood film song. He died before Hrithik was born. But even Hrithik's grandmother - variously credited as "Ira Nagrath" and "Ira Roshan" - is herself a musician-composer who completed her husband's films at Roshan's death and continued for many years as assistant music director on her son's projects - Hrithik's uncle, multiple Filmfare Award winning composer Rajesh Roshan. Hrithik's father - Rakesh Roshan - entered the film industry as an assistant to J. Om Prakash before shifting to actor, a successful leading man in such films as Khubsoorat (1980). Rakesh later organised the family film company, FilmKraft Productions (India) Pvt. Ltd., first as producer and later director. Meanwhile Hrithik graduated from Mumbai's prestigious Bombay Scottish School and took a Bachelor of Commerce degree first class from Sydenham College. He turned down a UCLA master's degree scholarship to enter films. To learn the craft of film from the ground up, from Khel (1992) through Koyla (1997) Hrithik toiled as a largely uncredited assistant on the family's film projects, gradually progressing from such unglamorous tasks as set-sweeping, tea-fetching, or clapper-loading up to a major role in story development, camera, direction, and editing. All the while Hrithik studied acting, dance, martial arts, and even bodybuilding (having always been hopelessly thin) to prepare himself to become a film actor. 14 January 2000: Hrithik Roshan's resultant debut film, Kaho Naa ... Pyaar Hai, not only firmly established Hrithik as dramatic hero, romantic hero, and action hero, but actually revolutionised the Hindi film industry in significant ways.</p>
